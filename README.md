# Leaderboard Project

> In this project I have set up a JavaScript project for the Leaderboard list app, using webpack and ES6 features, notably modules. I have developed a first working version of the app following a wireframe. I have consumed the Leaderboard API using JavaScript async and await and added some styling.
